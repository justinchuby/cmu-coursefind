## Introduction

The project I am working on is a course finder, **CourseFind**.

I had the idea one day when I was wandering in Wean Hall at CMU. I saw students having classes and hoped to find out what classes they were having. I could just walk in and see what was going on, but it would be much better if I knew something about the class.

With CourseFind, students can easily find out what’s going on in a class room. So they can explore what’s course is interests them. CourseFind is also great for finding the room for a class, or just browsing the catalog to find what’s interesting.
